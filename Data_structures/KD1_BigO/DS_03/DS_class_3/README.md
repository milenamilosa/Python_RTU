# Stack and Queue Implementation in Python

This repository is dedicated to demonstrating the implementation of two fundamental data structures in Python: the stack and the queue. Both structures are pivotal in computer science, offering different ways to store and manage data. This example aims to provide clear, concise, and efficient implementations, making it easier for learners to grasp the concepts and apply them in various programming scenarios.

## Overview

### Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The most recent element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates; you can only add or remove the top plate. This implementation showcases basic stack operations such as push, pop, and peek.

### Queue
In contrast, a queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. The first element added is the first one to be removed, akin to a queue at a checkout. This implementation covers fundamental queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, and front.

## Features

- **Stack Implementation**: Demonstrates creating a stack, pushing items onto the stack, popping items from the stack, and peeking at the top item of the stack.
- **Queue Implementation**: Shows how to create a queue, enqueue items to the queue, dequeue items from the queue, and retrieve the front item of the queue.
- **Examples and Use Cases**: Includes examples demonstrating how to use the stack and queue in various scenarios.
