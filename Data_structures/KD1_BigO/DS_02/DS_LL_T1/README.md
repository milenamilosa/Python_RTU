# Linked List Implementation in Python (1)

This repository demonstrates how to implement the Linked List data structure in Python. Each example file covers a different aspect of working with linked lists, from basic operations to more complex manipulations.

## Files and Descriptions

- `ex_1.py` – Demonstrates how to use the dictionary data type to code the linked list structure.
- `ex_2.py` – Demonstrates how to initialize the linked list structure and how to create a new node.
- `ex_3.py` - Demonstrates how to print elements from the linked list data structure.
- `ex_4.py` - Demonstrates how to append elements to the linked list data structure.
- `ex_5.py` - Demonstrates how to pop elements from the linked list data structure.
